**Description:**

From the very beginning, the magnitude and meaning of the "Conquest" of
Mexico has been a point of controversy and acclaim. Worlds were upended.
An empire fell. Milwithout proper acknowledgement from a source (plagiarism).

## Late Papers## Appropriate Use of Course Materials

The materials distributed in this class, including the syllabus, exams, handouts,
Only late papers accompanied by a valid
excuse (illness with doctor\'s note, university sanctioned
extra-curricular activity, family emergency, etc.) will be accepted
without penalty. All other late papers will be penalized one full letter
grade on the day following the due date (A to B) and one third of a
letter grade (B to B-) for each day after that. Missed assignments will
be assigned a score of zero.

## Academic Integrity

**Please do your own work. Plagiarism will not be tolerated in any form.** The students and faculty of Denison
University are committed to academic integrity and will not tolerate any
violation of this principle.  Academic honesty, the cornerstone of
teaching and learning, lays the foundation for lifelong integrity.

![Denison Logo](media/image1.jpg)

Academic dishonesty is, in most cases, intellectual theft. It includes,ed through the cumulative impacts
of war and disease. Christendom was vastly expanded. And, a new society,
a colonial society, was constructed.

The readings in this course take us through the historiography of the
Conquest, from its original Spanish and indigenous chroniclers through
current interpretations and approaches. Along the way we will treat the
complexities, myths, and legacies of the process of Spanish conquest.
Key questions include -- how do we account for the Spanish victory and
for the consolidation of Spanish power in Mesoamerica? Conversely, how
do we account for indigenous defeat? What role did the Catholic Church,
Spanish settlers, and indigenous peoples play in the fall of the Aztecs
and the consolidation of conquest society?

## Course Goals

**What I want for you -**

*CRITICAL THINKING AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION - I want to know what YOU,
not others and not computers, think about a question. And, I want to
help YOU refine your ability to communicate those amazing thoughts in
written and oral form.*

*INFORMATION LITERACY and ACTIVE READING - These are core components of
the skills above. We have to work to figure out what a source says; why
it says it; what it doesn't say; why it doesn't say it; and, how all of
those answers help us interpret, engage, and use a source to answer our
specific (historical) questions.*

Written and oral communication skills are going to be key to your
success at Denison and beyond. The primary goal of this course,
therefore, is to strengthen your abilities as an effective writer,
speaker, and listener. Much of what we teach at Denison is critical
thinking, the ability to assess various types of arguments and to
construct arguments of your own that will stand up to the critical
assessment of others. To that end, in this class we will work to:

1)  Sharpen your ability to

    a.  Ask complex yet answerable questions

    b.  Articulate and communicate complex theses/arguments

    c.  Marshal evidence in support of those arguments in written and
        > oral forms in order to prove your position

2)  Hone your skills at interpreting various types of written and visual
    > sources and historical literature, to reinforce your ability to
    > identify and critique the various explicit and implicit arguments
    > within such sources, and to employ such sources in the service of
    > making your own written and oral arguments.

3)  Further transform you from a passive to an active recipient of
    > information. To encourage critical reading and viewing as a key to
    > success in college and beyond.

4)  Strengthen your skills at expressing your informed conclusions about
    > any topic in written forms.

5)  Strengthen your skills at expressing your informed conclusions about
    > any topic in oral forms AND hearing the informed conclusions of
    > others and responding to them.

**Writing*: This course fulfills one of the two Writing Overlay (W)
General Education Requirements. ***A primary objective of this course is
to cultivate students' habits as effective writers by assisting you to
improve your abilities to conceptualize, write, and revise effective
nonfiction expository and analytical prose. Effective writing is clear,
unified, concise, informed, persuasive, and thoughtful. It requires the
recognition that writing is not linear, but is a complex and often
cyclical process that eventually results in a finished, polished
product. And, effective writing must take into account the importance of
intended (and unintended) audience(s).

**Orality/Aurality: *This course also fulfills the Oral Competency
Overlay (R) General Education requirement.*** We will spend significant
time this semester discussing and practicing various dimensions of oral
communication: understanding audience and setting, selecting and
organizing information and/or constructing oral arguments, speaking with
clarity and effect, listening effectively, and attending to disciplinary
and cultural conventions of speaking and listening.

To fulfill this goal, we will focus on three forms of Oral Communication
(orality and aurality) that are central to your success both as a
student at Denison and in your personal, professional, and civic lives
after you leave Denison --

-   **In-Class Discussion --** Early in the semester we, as a group,
    > will establish the criteria and rules for in-class discussions.
    > Further, we will regularly anonymously assess the quality of
    > in-class discussions and identify ways that we, as individual
    > participants, can improve them.

-   **Formal Presentations --** Two times throughout the semester
    > students will do formal presentations focused on in-class readings
    > (those presentations must focus on the assigned readings for the
    > same day as your presentation).

    -   For the first presentation, students will present a formal
        > presentation on assigned readings of primary sources (you
        > should focus on the reading assigned for that day) in teams of
        > two (2). That presentation should be approximately 8 minutes
        > followed by Q&A from your classmates.

    -   For the second round of presentations, students will work
        > independently to produce a 60-90 second podcast focused on the
        > indigenous primary sources.

    -   For the third round of presentations, students will work in
        > teams of three to produce a 6-8 minute podcast that assesses
        > the arguments of an assigned secondary source(s). They will
        > then field questions from their classmates about their
        > presentation.

    -   **Presentations that summarize a reading can receive no higher
        > than a C-**. The goal is to identify arguments and mark
        > arguments of your own.

    - Students will also anonymously assess/review these presentations
      (see attached [rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1alJgfxDF6ufjN5xjkC5WOUBGwozWKzDe/view?usp=sharing))
      and will reflect on how we can improve our own presentations
      based on witnessing others' work.

    -   **Presentation Advice -** Work to use *They Say/I Say* as the
        > model of your presentations. Identify the primary arguments
        > (or most interesting arguments) that you see emanating from
        > the primary or secondary source you are presenting on, **AND**
        > respond to that with an argument of your own. Also, plan your
        > presentation in advance and seek out advice from your
        > professor if you think that would be helpful.

    -   **Peer Reviews of Classmates' Presentations --** The quality and
        > depth of your review of your peers' presentations will also be
        > assessed and will contribute to your final grade.

-   **Podcast --**The final assignment for this course will focus on a
    > podcast focused on an element of the Conquest of Mexico. You will
    > treat this like a research project, but the final product will be
    > a podcast.

> What does it mean to treat it like a research paper? You will conduct
> research, you will present an argument, you will identify and present
> potential counterarguments

## Assignments

### Tutorials

The electronic version of *They Say/I Say*
that you are required to purchase includes a series of tutorials for
each chapter. You are expected to finish the tutorial for each chapter
on the day that it is assigned. (However, you will have an additional
week to complete them for credit. After that you can complete them, but
you will not receive credit towards your final grade).

**DO NOT WAIT TO COMPLETE THESE TUTORIALS**

You will be graded only on completion. If you complete 100% you will
receive an A+ for this portion of your grade. You complete your
Tutorials here (Please select the "Tutorial Tab" after having read the
associated chapter through Canvas.

### Papers
(specific prompts for each paper can be found on the weekly schedule)

These papers will be formal historical essays, which will be graded on
the thoughtfulness of the argument (thesis) and the degree to which the
thesis is supported by cited evidence.

> *You may tailor these essays to your final research topic/questions,
> if and when you define it, so long as your topic plays an explanatory
> role in the outcome of the Conquest.*
>
> The prompts encourage you to employ the *They Say/I Say* model,
> failure to do so can negatively impact your final grade.

***Failure to submit a complete initial draft of a paper will carry an
automatic 10% penalty on the final grade for that paper.***

***Please use "Track Changes" in Word to mark the revisions you make to
your original draft. You can turn on "track changes" under the review
tab (and can set it so that you cannot see all the change you make if
you like).***

***To submit a final paper, please upload the final revision (with Track
Changes) to Canvas.***

**Paper Format:** The papers must be double spaced, 12-point
font, have proper footnotes, and must be saved in as a Word file (.doc).
Papers submitted as Google Docs or as a Works file will be considered
late. (see the *Chicago Manual of Style, 17^th^ ed*., for style
guidelines). **YOUR PAPER MUST BE 1250-1500 words in length (excluding
notes).**

For a guide to the proper citation style, consult the section on the
"Chicago Manual of Style, 17^th^ edition" in Bullock, Brody, and
Weinberg, *The Little Seagull Handbook*, 192-226.

**Failure to include proper citations in footnotes will result in a 10%
penalty on your final grade for that assignment.**

On each paper please include the following: Name, date, and Word Count
in the upper left-hand corner followed by the title centered on the page
(please do not include a title page).

**Informal Assignments** - Students will be asked to upload copies of
their initial drafts AND pictures of their peer review sheets. These
will be graded on a 0, 50, 75, 100 grading scale. Students who do not
submit a full initial draft will receive a full grade reduction in the
final grade for that assignment (A- to a B-).

### Critical Literature Review

Your task is to identify a major question about the conquest of Mexico
(say, the role of Doña Marina), and to write a 500-word essay that
identifies how three different authors we read (11/06-11/17) seek to
answer that question. You should seek to put those authors in
conversation, to identify the major (and minor) differences between
their positions, and to signal to your readers which arguments you find
most convincing. (HINT - try to avoid writing separate paragraphs on
each author, but work to combine their ideas within a single idea of
your own. For example,

> *Scholars disagree on the sexual relationship between Doña Marina and
> Hernán Cortés and those disagreements help us identify the contours of
> larger debates about the Conquest. For example, Scholar X treats her
> as a rape victim, and thus as the embodiment of the Spanish violation
> of native peoples. Scholar Y counters that Malintzin was a historical
> agent making the best decisions possible for herself under the
> circumstances, even as it relates to sex. Malintzin then becomes a
> model of indigenous self-determination within the conquest, removing
> them from the position of only victims.*

### Final Project

Working individually, you will complete a research project on some
element of the Conquest of Mexico and use it to produce a Podcast. You
are free to select the focus of your project, in consultation with the
professor, ***so long as you can address the topic relying (primarily)
on the materials we read together in class***. (A great example of this
is the topic of human sacrifice. This is a complicated project, but you
would need to focus your consideration on the role of human sacrifice in
the context of the conquest; rather than pursue a deep study of the
religious and political meanings of sacrifice to Mesoamericans.)

The goal is to make a historical argument relative to the Conquest of
Mexico, not to present an encyclopedic summation of a topic or issue.
**To that end, your paper will consist of two parts. You MUST present an
argument, and a full counter argument (at least 150 words), on your
topic. We will develop the specific nature of the two elements of your
paper in consultation with each other.**

**Format --** This project is different from the first four we have
written this semester. While those have been restricted to considering
how the authors we have read explained the conquest, and responding to
them; or, to a specific literature review, this project is your
opportunity to explore a topic of your choice relative to the conquest.
The only requirement is that you rely heavily on the readings we've
completed and discussed together as a class, *particularly the primary
sources*. Your experiences with your first four papers should help you
write sections of your final project, but to help you conceptualize the
podcast I would encourage you to consider and include the following:

1)  Write for an uninitiated audience (think about what this suggests
    > you should include or leave out)

2)  Provide a brief narrative of events (that are important to your
    > topic)

3)  Include a reference to other arguments section relevant to your
    > topic

4)  Draw specific evidence from the primary sources we've read this
    > semester to support your arguments

    a.  ***You might conceive of this as a dialog in which one side
        > makes an argument, another side makes a counterargument*, and
        > you indicate where you fall in the debate.**

5)  In the end, you will need to reach a formal conclusion, but the
    > purpose of this exercise is to encourage us to fully consider
    > arguments that contradict our own in the pursuit of presenting our
    > own argument.

6)  Oh, and make it entertaining, something that you would want your
    > parents or your roommates to hear.

**The project must**

1)  **Articulate a historical question that emanates out of the *primary
    > sources* on the conquest of Mexico**

    a.  **TO BE CLEAR, your reading of the primary sources must be the
        > basis for your argument and thus you want to spend time
        > explicating the source, within the context of your arguments,
        > to your reader.**

2) **Engage the ideas of others in service of making your arguments.**

|                 |   |                           |
+-----------------+---+---------------------------+

You will conduct library and Internet research, locating a minimum of
eight (8) different sources to complete your final project. A minimum of
four of those sources must be scholarly works (secondary sources -
either monographs, chapters from edited volumes, or academic journal
articles); and, at least **two** of those sources must be different from
assigned readings for the course.

In this paper, much like the three short papers written earlier in the
semester your primary goal is to advance an historical argument.

As part of the research process, students will submit the following
stepping stone assignments

> **Initial Thoughts on Final Research Paper** -- In 250 words, please
> identify the topic and major questions that you plan to address in the
> final paper. Please include a list of potential sources that you plan
> to use *beyond* those assigned for class.
>
> **The Annotated Bibliography:** For the annotated bibliography, please
> open with a one paragraph summation of your research project and
> research questions. Then, list each source you will employ in your
> research with a bibliographic citation in *Chicago Manual of Style,
> 16^t\ h^* *Edition* style, followed by an annotation (in one to three
> sentences) which contains your evaluative comments indicating the
> nature of the source, any special problems it might pose (e.g.,
> excessive bias), and how it will contribute to your work. Make sure
> the annotations are in your own words. Your bibliography should
> include separate sections for primary and secondary sources. You may
> use sources listed in the syllabus, but a significant expectation is
> that you will also find a significant number of sources not included
> there.
>
> **The Argument Proposal:** Once you have completed the research to
> compose your Annotated Bibliography, you should have a better idea of
> what it is you want to argue, so that's when you will submit a brief
> proposal (a paragraph or two) of your argument. Though this is
> preliminary and you're not wedded to it for your final project, I urge
> you to think hard about this portion of the assignment. Test your
> ideas with me, with friends, with consultants in the Writing Center.
> Do more research as you focus more intensely. The sooner you begin
> thinking about these ideas and trying them out on paper, the better
> you'll do in constructing your argument and not panicking about
> writing the paper at the last minute. This proposal must include a
> thesis, the types of evidence you intend to use, and the
> conclusion---the answer to the "so what?" question---you expect to
> reach.
>
> **This can be accomplished in no more than three paragraphs - a
> statement about your topic, your questions, and what you plan to argue
> (while indicating how your sources might help you).**

The script for your podcast paper should utilize the materials you've
found in your research to present a historical argument. The goal is not
an encyclopedic summary of information about your topic of interest, but
rather an argument.

**Podcast --** You will also prepare and present a podcast on your
research project as part of your final project. You will need to submit
both an audio file (and a script) of that portion of the project. Please
include a title for your podcast, an intro and outro, and music for
transitions. You may use multiple voices (if you want to have a
classmate read primary sources, or use a dialogue format, but you must
be the dominant voice).

The podcast should be no longer than ten (10) minutes long. The primary
goal is to present your major questions, arguments, and evidence in oral
form. You can treat this as very similar to the previous two
presentations you will have completed throughout the semester.

The length of the podcast means that you cannot simply "read" a paper
from start to finish (reading one double-spaced page takes 2-2.5
minutes). So, your goal should be to think about the most important
information and arguments from your final project that you need to
include to allow your listener to understand your questions and
arguments. And, you should think hard about how to engage you listeners
with that information.

To facilitate our understanding of the difference between a podcast and
"reading a paper out loud," you will be required to write and submit a
script for your podcast.

**Hint --** this should also help you during the revision process. Try
to think of the podcast and paper assignments as complementary and not
as distinct.

Hints --

-   Give your podcast a name (not the title of your paper, but of the
    > podcast series yours might fit into - MY FAVORITE PODCAST IS "If
    > Books Could Kill")

-   Think about audience (it should be aimed at someone who is not a
    > student/professor in our class)

Please upload your final as an MP3 file (not a .wav file)

## Grades and Grading

Grading is a pedagogical tool. It is meant to signal to students where
and how they can improve on meeting the expectations for the assignments
in our class. They are not a reflection of ability, character, or
effort. My comments on assignments are meant to highlight where
improvement is possible on that assignment and should serve as
guideposts for future assignments. They are not a road map to earning
"A's." That may take time and practice. And, I am here to help you in
that journey.

I believe strongly in the power of constructive criticism, so my
comments will identify strengths I see in a particular assignment but
will focus more so on the areas that I see where improvement is
possible.

***LETTER GRADES ON FORMAL ESSAYS:***

An "**A**" signifies that all of the rhetorical, grammatical, and
stylistic features of an essay demonstrate a nearly professional polish
and work together to advance a clear, interesting, persuasive, and
significant analytic argument. The essay exhibits superior skill in
reading texts closely and interpreting them, not merely offering
opinions about them. The ideas are organized in a sequence that
reinforces the logic of the thesis, and they are illustrated and
supported by well-chosen and coherently integrated quotations and
details from the subject text. Such an essay demonstrates the writer's
awareness of the readers' needs. It doesn't waste their time with
filler, irrelevant material, or needlessly wordy phrasing. Nor does it
neglect to explain complex ideas and to enable the readers to experience
them with powerful detail and textual support. An "A" essay is unified,
coherent, focused, developed, precisely phrased, interesting,
significant, and stylistically effective.

A "**B**" signifies that an essay shows much promise, that with some
careful revising and further development (not just editing) it might
have the potential to earn an "A." Between adequate and excellent, a "B"
essay offers and supports intelligent arguments that unify and shape the
subsequent paragraphs. The \"B\" paper does not display the high level
of close reading and originality of thought of the \"A\" paper. It may
contain several minor problems in logic and interpretation, such as
occasional lack of sufficient analysis of quotations. But it will show
evident care, persuasive analysis, and reliable facility with
grammatical skills. It may lack the fresh insight or the impressive
power of phrasing that is evident in an "A" paper, but it shows thought
and planning as it advances an important interpretive argument.

A "**C**" indicates that an essay meets the minimal requirements of an
assignment. It makes an argument though it might be obvious and
commonplace. The essay presents quoted passages to support its claims
but has not always made their relevance clear to the reader. The \"C\"
paper may contain too much summary of the text without sufficient
analysis of it. Its argument may contain illogical conclusions or
problems in interpretation caused by misreading. A "C" essay does not
demonstrate the grammatical control that produces emphatic and clear
phrasing. There are likely to be occasional grammatical errors---though
not so frequent that they distract the reader from the ideas being
discussed.

A "**D**" essay might show effort and insight but it lacks the basic
features that enable an essay to be read with understanding---such
things as unity, clear focus, grammatical control, clear and purposeful
organization, audience awareness, sufficiency of supporting detail and
quoted evidence. A "D" essay might be in an early phase of drafting. It
might wander from its key idea into irrelevant ideas or to things that
were added merely to reach a target length. It might offer ideas that
don't go beyond the familiar and use overly general phrasing and clichés
without showing successful engagement with complex ideas.

A paper might fail if it's extremely difficult to read, if it doesn't
have an idea that connects its parts, if it doesn't offer support for
its claims, if it's merely summary and not argument, if it doesn't
fulfill the assignment, if ideas are not grouped into paragraphs, or if
persistent grammatical errors draw the readers' attention away from the
topic. An essay might also fail if phrases or ideas have been used
without proper acknowledgement from a source (plagiarism).

**[Late Papers:]{.underline}** Only late papers accompanied by a valid
excuse (illness with doctor\'s note, university sanctioned
extra-curricular activity, family emergency, etc.) will be accepted
without penalty. All other late papers will be penalized one full letter
grade on the day following the due date (A to B) and one third of a
letter grade (B to B-) for each day after that. Missed assignments will
be assigned a score of zero.

**[Academic Integrity]{.underline}: Please do your own work. Plagiarism
will not be tolerated in any form.** The students and faculty of Denison
University are committed to academic integrity and will not tolerate any
violation of this principle.  Academic honesty, the cornerstone of
teaching and learning, lays the foundation for lifelong integrity.
![](media/image1.jpg){width="1.125in" height="1.65625in"}

Academic dishonesty is, in most cases, intellectual theft. It includes,
but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner not
authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for
evaluation. This standard applies to all work ranging from daily
homework assignments to major exams. Students **must clearly cite** any
sources consulted---not only for quoted phrases but also for ideas and
information that are not common knowledge. Neither ignorance nor
carelessness is an acceptable defense in cases of plagiarism. It is the
student's responsibility to follow the appropriate format for citations.
Students should ask the professor for assistance in determining what
sorts of materials and assistance are appropriate for assignments and
for guidance in citing such materials clearly.

Proposed and developed by Denison students, passed unanimously by DCGA
and Denison's faculty, the **Code of Academic Integrity** requires that
instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic
dishonesty, and it requires that cases be heard by the Academic
Integrity Board. Further, the code makes students responsible for
promoting a culture of integrity on campus and acting in instances in
which integrity is violated. The punishment for plagiarism/academic
dishonesty in this class will be a grade of zero for the assignment in
question and potentially a failing grade for the course in egregious
cases.

**Note on Technology and AI:**

While AI tools like ChatGPT and BARD can be powerful tools, you should
not rely on them to complete your assignment. Doing so may constitute a
violation of the Denison University Academic Integrity Policy. (We will
have a class day focused on how AI works, and how it might be
appropriate to use it on an assignment like those required in this
class).

Uploading or inputting personal or proprietary information---including
course materials or academic books and journal articles that you
download from JSTOR or other password-protected databases---to an AI
Chatbot site like ChatGPT or Bard may violate copyright law.

**[Appropriate Use of Course Materials:]{.underline}** The materials
distributed in this class, including the syllabus, exams, handouts,
study aids, and in-class presentations, may be protected by copyright
and are provided solely for the educational use of students enrolled in
this course.  You are not permitted to redistribute them for purposes
unapproved by the instructor; in particular you are not permitted to
post course materials or your notes from lectures and discussion on
commercial websites (or upload them to a Generative AI site).
Unauthorized uses of course materials may be considered academic
misconduct.

## Disability Statement

Any student who feels he or she
may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should
contact me privately as soon as possible to discuss his or her specific
needs. I rely on the Academic Support & Enrichment Center in 104 Doane
to verify the need for reasonable accommodations.

## Writing Center

The Center is a free resource
available to all Denison students.  Student writing consultants from
many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing
process, from deciphering the assignment, to discussing ideas, to
developing an argument, to finalizing a draft.  Please visit the
[[Writing Center
Website]{.underline}](https://denison.edu/academics/support/the-writing-center)
for locations and hours.

## L2 or Multilingual Support

In addition to the
academic support services available to all Denison students, students
who use English in addition to other languages can meet with Denison's
Coordinator of Multilingual Learning, Kalynda Thayer. If English is not
your first or only language, please consider utilizing this resource,
which is available to ALL Denison students. Ms. Thayer offers a variety
of support for L2 students, including consulting with you about your
written language (grammar, syntax, word-choices), strategies to manage
your reading assignments, assistance with class conversation and
presentations, and to help devising ways to develop and effectively use
all your skills in English. You can email her at thayerk\@denison.edu to
schedule an appointment.

**The course adheres to Denison's Academic Credit Policy.** Significant
feedback on writing is a core component of this course. Students are
expected to review instructor feedback and reflect on how to incorporate
that into their future work. Throughout the semester, students will
complete group assignments and they are expected to meet together with
their group mates and with the professor for guidance on group projects.
